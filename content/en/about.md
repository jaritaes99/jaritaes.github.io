Hello, I am Jose Arita-Escalante, an aspiring theorerical physicist with an interest in General Relativity. I am currently a Post-Bacc Research Assistant for [Dr. Tyler Parsotan](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/tmpataki) at NASA Goddard 
Space Flight Center (GSFC). We are currently working on quantifying the effect that the Hydrodynamic resolution of GRB simulations have on the [Monte Carlo Radiation Transfer (MCRaT)](https://github.com/parsotat/ProcessMCRaT) post-processing 
radiative transfer calculations.

I am a first-generation Honduran-American, and I used to live in Honduras until I was 17 years old. I moved to Virginia, and did my undegraduate studies in Virginia Commonwealth University. I got a B.S. in Physics and a 
B.S. in Mathematical Sciences. I am taking a gap year from my studies while working with Dr. Parsotan. In August 2023, I will be a Physics Master's student in the [Fisk-Vanderbilt Master's-to-PhD Bridge 
Program](https://www.fisk-vanderbilt-bridge.org). My ultimate goal is to 
become a researcher and professor, not only to create science but also spread my accrued knowledge. 

Outreach is very important to me, and I am always trying to become involved in it. When I heard about [Alpha-Cen](https://astro.alphacen.org/en/), an organization that aims to provide research opportunities in the 
astronomical siences in Central America and the Caribbean, I felt a need to join and become involved with it. I moved to the United States because I knew it was going to be hard to secure a future as a theoretical physicist 
in Honduras due to the lack of opportunities in third world countries. I want to help students who are in similar situations that I found myself in back then but that might not have the same opportunities I had. 

In this website, you will find useful information such as my LinkedIn, GitHub, resum√©, contact information, current and past research projects, and a quick blog about what I have been up to.
