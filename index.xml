I am currently a Post-Bacc Research Assistant for Dr. Tyler Parsotan at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). We are currently working on optimizing the resolution for the Monte Carlo Radiation Transfer (MCRaT) radiative transfer predictions.
I am a first-generation Honduran-American, and I used to live in Honduras until I was 17 years old. I moved to Virginia, and did my undegraduate studies in Virginia Commonwealth University.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://jaritaes99.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaritaes99.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Feel free to reach out!

MCRaT injects photons into the HD simulation and conduces scattering of the photons to then measure the electromagnetic signature of the simulated GRB. I have been working on finding the effects that lowering both the spatial and temporal resolution of the HD simulation for the sake of reducing computational time and resource allocation has on the outcome of the simulation.</description></item></channel></rss>
